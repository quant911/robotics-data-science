VEX/ VEX IQ events generate a lot of data on teams and their performance. Such information is accessible from robotevents.com.

This repo uses modern Python tools to analyze and visualize team and event data. 

WARNING: github may NOT display the notebook at all, as it does not have plotly (cufflinks) installed. (could be a TODO item if I know how to fix it).
